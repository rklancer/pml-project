pml-project
===========

This repository was created as part of an assignment [Coursera](http://coursera.com)'s [Practical Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/predmachlearn). It includes code to predict classes of errors in weightlifting form using [data](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har#weight_lifting_exercises) from body-worn sensors.

A writeup (containing all the required code) is hosted on the gh-pages site: http://rklancer.github.io/pml-project/
